# Migraine World Summit 2025 Podcast Generator

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This tool requires valid Migraine World Summit login credentials and an active subscription. This is not a way to circumvent paying for access to the summit content. The tool is designed to help organize and access content you have already paid for through the official channels.**

This project provides a more convenient way to listen to Migraine World Summit 2025 talks by converting them into a private podcast feed. While the summit content is available through the official website, accessing it through a podcast player offers several advantages:

- **Better Mobile Experience**: Listen on the go without needing to log in through a web browser
- **Improved Car Integration**: Use your car's media controls and display instead of fiddling with a mobile browser
- **Progress Tracking**: Easily keep track of which talks you've listened to and resume from where you left off
- **Offline Access**: Download episodes for offline listening when you don't have internet access
- **Familiar Interface**: Use your preferred podcast player's interface instead of the website
- **Background Play**: Keep listening while using other apps on your phone

The tool works by:
1. Fetching the talk metadata from the Migraine World Summit website
2. Converting them into a podcast feed format
3. Allowing you to subscribe to this feed in your favorite podcast player

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver (for Selenium)
- **Valid Migraine World Summit login credentials and an active subscription**

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MWS2025-PodcastFeedGenerator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install ChromeDriver:
   - This step is alittle unusual but since their are dynamic elements that are loaded on demand, an active browser with selenium is used.
   - Download ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   - Make sure the version matches your Chrome browser version
   - Place the ChromeDriver executable in your system PATH or in the project directory

## Usage

The process consists of two steps:

### Step 1: Fetch Talk Details
```bash
python fetch_talk_details.py
```
When prompted, enter your Migraine World Summit credentials:
- Username (email)
- Password

This script will:
- Log in to the Migraine World Summit website
- Scrape the available talks
- Save the results to `talks.json`

### Step 2: Generate Podcast Feed
```bash
python create_podcast_feed.py
```
This script will:
- Read the talk details from `talks.json`
- Generate a podcast feed in XML format
- Save the feed to `mws2025_podcast.xml`

### Step 3: Host the Podcast Feed
To make your podcast feed accessible to your podcast player, you'll need to host the `mws2025_podcast.xml` file at a URL that your podcast player can access. For privacy and security reasons, use a private hosting solution rather than a publicly discoverable one.

1. **Amazon S3 Bucket (Recommended)**:
   - Create a new S3 bucket
   - Configure appropriate access controls
   - Upload the XML file
   - The URL will be in the format: `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/mws2025_podcast.xml`

2. **Private Web Hosting**:
   - Upload the XML file to a private web hosting service
   - Ensure the file is accessible via HTTPS
   - Make sure the server serves the file with the correct MIME type (`application/xml` or `text/xml`)

**Privacy Note**: The content in the podcast feed is protected by copyright and your subscription agreement. Do not share the feed URL publicly. Keep the feed URL private and only using it in your personal podcast player.

Once you have the URL, you can add it to your podcast player of choice.

## Output Files

- `talks.json`: Contains the raw data of all scraped talks (generated by `fetch_talk_details.py`)
- `mws2025_podcast.xml`: The generated podcast feed in XML format (generated by `create_podcast_feed.py`)

## Dependencies

- requests==2.31.0
- beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
- selenium==4.18.1
- feedgen==1.0.0

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure ChromeDriver is properly installed and accessible
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Check that your Migraine World Summit credentials are correct
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
5. Make sure `talks.json` exists before running `create_podcast_feed.py`
6. Verify that your podcast feed URL is accessible and returns the correct MIME type

## Notes

- The scripts require an active internet connection
- Your login credentials are only used for authentication and are not stored
- The generated podcast feed can be used with any podcast player that supports XML feeds
- You must run `fetch_talk_details.py` before `create_podcast_feed.py` as the latter depends on the output of the former
- Make sure to keep your hosted XML file up to date by re-running the scripts and uploading the new file when new talks are available
